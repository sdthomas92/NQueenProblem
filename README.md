# N Queen Problem

This is an Artificial Intelligence project which allows the user to solve the N-Queen problem by using two different local search algorithms: Hill-Climbing algorithm and a Genetic algorithm. The N-Queen problem involves finding a configuration where an n number of queens are placed on an n x n chess board where no queen can attack another queen. By default, the program sets n to be 18. Because the Hill-Climbing algorithm finds the best solution locally, it is not optimal, and doesn't always find a solution, however, the Genetic algorithm does.
